/**
 * PaymentService — the single gateway for the Payments module (Phase 16).
 *
 * Owns Payment creation, provider-result application, and Refunds — both
 * live in this one Service because a refund always mutates the SAME
 * `payments` row (its `refunded_amount` rollup + status) inside the SAME
 * transaction as the new `refunds` row, so splitting them into two
 * services would only add indirection without a real seam (they share one
 * aggregate). Ledger reads are a separate, independent concern —
 * `ledgerService.js` owns those.
 *
 * CRITICAL invariant (Phase 16 spec §7): payment truth is established
 * HERE, from the provider's response or a verified webhook — never from
 * a client-supplied "it succeeded" claim. `bookingService.recordPaymentOutcome`
 * is only ever called with a status this Service itself resolved.

   *
   * Stripe go-live preflight fix: previously assumed every event was a

   * status to `null`, which `isValidPaymentStatusTransition` then threw
   * a bare (non-`AppError`) `TypeError` on — an uncaught 500, not a
   * clean, logged failure. Now dispatches on the provider's own
   * `normalized.kind` (`'payment'` / `'refund'` / `'unhandled'`, see
   * `StripePaymentProvider#normalizeWebhookEvent`) to the correct
   * table/vocabulary, and an unmapped status for a kind this app DOES
   * act on is recorded as a failed event (webhook still ACKs 200 — no
   * retry can fix an app that doesn't understand the status it
