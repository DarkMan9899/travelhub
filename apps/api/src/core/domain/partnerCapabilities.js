/**
 * Partner-employee capability matrix — Phase 17 spec §14 ("Manager /
 * Staff Permissions"). `partner_employee_roles` (OWNER/MANAGER/EDITOR/
 * BOOKING_MANAGER/ANALYTICS_VIEWER, seeded in `seeds/001_lookups.js`) is
 * a partner-scoped RBAC system, deliberately separate from the global
 * `roles`/`permissions` tables (Sprint 5 decision, unchanged here) — a
 * receptionist-style `BOOKING_MANAGER` account must be able to operate
 * inventory without ever touching a partner's financial settings,
 * payouts, or org-wide configuration, and this matrix is what enforces
 * that boundary server-side (never just by hiding a nav item).
 *
 * Pure domain logic — no database access, no request/response shapes.
 * `OWNER` is intentionally NOT special-cased here: every caller of
 * `roleHasCapability` already grants `OWNER` a bypass one level up
 * (mirrors `AvailabilityService#isOwnerOrHasPermission`'s existing
 * "owner always passes" precedent), so this matrix only needs to state
 * what *non-owner* roles may do.
