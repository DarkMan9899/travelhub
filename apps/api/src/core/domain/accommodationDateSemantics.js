/**
 * Phase 17 §60/§61 date-semantics fix — resolves the actual calendar-day
 * range a stay/rental/departure consumes and gets priced for, given the
 * bookable unit's type.
 *
 * Every date-range write in this codebase (holds, bookings, manual
 * blocks, external reservations) previously treated `[dateFrom, dateTo]`
 * as inclusive on both ends everywhere, uniformly. That is correct for a
 * fixed-duration booking (a 3-day car rental, a tour running Mon-Wed) but
 * wrong for lodging: a guest who checks in 2026-08-10 and checks out
 * 2026-08-12 stays 2 nights (Aug 10, Aug 11) — checkout morning is not an
 * occupied night. Treating `dateTo` as inclusive there both over-consumes
 * capacity and over-charges by one full day/night on every accommodation
 * booking, a real, silent pricing bug, not merely a display quirk.
 *
 * `HOTEL_ROOM`/`PROPERTY_UNIT` (Sprint 9's `BOOKABLE_UNIT_TYPES`) are the
 * only two types this platform models as lodging — `RESTAURANT_TABLE`
 * (a single sitting), `TOUR_DEPARTURE` (a fixed-length itinerary or, per
 * Phase 17's additive `time_slot_start/end`, a single-day departure), and
 * `VEHICLE` (a rental billed by the calendar day, inclusive of the return
 * day) all keep the original inclusive-both-ends "duration" semantics —
 * this fix must NOT be applied to them (per the Phase 17 spec's explicit
 * instruction not to blindly generalize the accommodation fix).
 *
 * This is the single choke point every capacity-consuming write path
 * (`AvailabilityService#reserveCapacity`/`#restoreCapacityForRange`/
 * `#consumeCapacityForRange`) and the booking-pricing path
 * (`BookingService#resolveItem`) call through, so the fix applies
 * uniformly regardless of source (customer booking, partner manual
 * block, phone/OTA external reservation, or iCal sync) — never
 * re-implemented per call site.
