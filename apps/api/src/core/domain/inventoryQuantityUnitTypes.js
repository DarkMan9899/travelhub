/**
 * Launch-blocker remediation (P0-C) — bookable unit types whose
 * `capacity`/`availability_calendar.quantity_available` means "how many
 * interchangeable units of inventory exist" (compared against a fixed
 * `SEARCH_REQUESTED_QUANTITY`, never against the requested guest count),
 * as opposed to a per-unit occupancy ceiling (compared directly against
 * guests — see `mysqlSearchRepository.js`'s availability EXISTS block).
 *
 * HOTEL_ROOM/PROPERTY_UNIT: room-type inventory count.
 * VEHICLE: fleet inventory — under the current data model, one row per
 *   VIN — never a passenger-seat count (no such field exists; inventing
 *   one is out of scope here). Comparing it against `guests` was the
 *   P0-C bug: a single available vehicle was wrongly excluded from any
 *   `guests >= 2` search.
 * TOUR_DEPARTURE (and RESTAURANT_TABLE, unchanged/undetermined pending
 *   its own vertical) are deliberately NOT here — their `capacity` is a
 *   genuine seat/occupancy ceiling, compared directly against guests.
 *
 * Deliberately a separate list from `accommodationDateSemantics.js`'s
 * `ACCOMMODATION_BOOKABLE_UNIT_TYPES` — that one governs checkout-
 * exclusive vs. inclusive DATE semantics, which stay unchanged for
 * VEHICLE (inclusive-both-ends), so VEHICLE must never be added there.
