/**
 * BookingPaymentSection — the orchestrator embedded into a booking-detail
 * page (customer/partner/admin). Decides between a "Pay Now" control (no
 * payment yet, or the only ones on record are terminally FAILED/
 * CANCELLED — the customer may try again) and `PaymentSummaryCard` (an
 * active or succeeded payment exists). `readOnly` hides the "Pay Now"
 * control entirely for the partner/admin views, where paying is never the
 * viewer's own action.
 *
 * The "Pay Now" control itself is provider-dependent — `PayNowPanel`'s
 * local "simulate an outcome" control only ever makes sense against
 * `LocalPaymentProvider`; a real provider (Stripe) renders
 * `StripeCheckoutPanel`'s real Elements checkout instead. `provider`
 * (from `GET /payments/config`, alongside `enabled`) decides which,
 * without this component — or anything downstream — ever needing to load
 * Stripe.js when it isn't the active provider (go-live sequencing).
 *
 * Renders nothing while loading (the parent page's own Skeleton already
 * covers the loading state) and nothing on a genuine fetch error (a
 * payment section is supplementary, not the page's primary content —
 * failing to load it should never block the rest of the booking detail
 * page from rendering).

// 2026 SEO/performance audit: a real, measured bug — this file's own
// static `import StripeCheckoutPanel from '../StripeCheckoutPanel/...'`
// (what used to be here) bundled the entire Stripe SDK into whatever
// chunk THIS file landed in, regardless of whether the `provider ===
// 'stripe'` branch below is ever actually taken at runtime. A
// `manualChunks` override could isolate the SDK into its own file, but a
// real browser network capture proved that file still got fetched on
// Home/Category/Listing Detail — Rollup's own module graph needed a few
// of this chunk's re-exported bindings, which forced a static
// cross-chunk import back from the shared chunk. `React.lazy` is the
// correct, idiomatic fix: it makes the browser's fetch of this subtree
// conditional on the component actually being rendered, not just
// imported, with no manual chunk-graph fighting required.
