/**
 * categoryPresentation — Phase 18.7 (Category-Specific Detail
 * Experiences). Every section on the Listing Detail page is already
 * fully generic and metadata-driven (the Generic Attribute Engine's own
 * discipline: no per-category JSX branching, no hardcoded field lists —
 * see `MetadataFieldRenderer.jsx`'s header for the write-side precedent
 * this mirrors). What genuinely differs by category isn't which fields
 * exist — the EAV engine already handles that — it's what a visitor
 * actually cares about FIRST: a hotel guest reads amenities and policies
 * before anything else; a hiker wants the itinerary before the fine
 * print; a renter wants the vehicle specs up front. This module captures
 * that difference as small, additive PRESENTATION config — section
 * reading order and booking-CTA copy — keyed off `listing_type` (a
 * stable backend enum, already on every listing DTO), never new
 * components, never new fields, never a fork of any section's markup.
 *
 * `listing_type` codes come from `listing_types.code`
 * (HOTEL/PROPERTY/RESTAURANT/TOUR/CAR_RENTAL/ATTRACTION) — grouped here
 * into four presentation groups. Adding a new `listing_type` later only
 * needs one new line in `GROUP_BY_LISTING_TYPE`; everything else (every
 * section component, the metadata engine, the wizard) already handles it
 * generically with zero further change, exactly as `docs/BACKEND_
 * ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "Adding a New Category" walkthrough describes.
